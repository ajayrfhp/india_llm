## asd    



## Stage 1 - Fine tune QWEN 2.5 on hindi Q/A data. 
- [Here is perplexity's pathway for going about this](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-have-a-dataset-of-question-a-.KEF.xg1RBalbdmizMWJVQ)
    - [x] Install hugging face transformers library
    - [ ] Use Hugging Face Trainer API to fine tune
        - OOM error on local training
        - [ ] Spin up GPU instances in jarvis and fine tune
    - [x] How to tokenize hindi ?
